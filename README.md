Most of the code should be ready to go if the files are changed appropirately. 

To use the main segpatch notebook, going the through the databuilder might be helpful. It is what I had used. 

Notes:
1. Code is highly unoptimised. 
2. There may be small errors in terms of environment. 

If there are any logical errors, happy to help debug if needed :)

Regarding visualisation - a good prompt on the unpaid version of chatgpt should be quite easy to do. 
1. Start with prompting only the image
2. Then prompt a scatter plot
3. Replace the scatter plot values with the nhanes annotation.
