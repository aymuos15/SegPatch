data_prep.ipynb --> Converts the pkl files to png (because nnunet does not automatically accept .npy)

data_split --> 90/10 (train/test)

data_nnunet --> Change the file names, make all the labels [0 1]

To reproduce, simply run each notebook. You only need to specify your home path.

(All directories will be made and at the end, it'll be completely ready!)

Will add a .py file which does all the above together soon.
