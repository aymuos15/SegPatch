**Methods:**

This is for direct nnunet on the osteophyte locations of the vindr dataset. (.ipynb file has everything to build the data from scratch, including the exclusion of all images).

**Limitations:**

1. Major difference in image size.

2. I have not considered any healthy sample or any other disease.

**Next Steps (If we get Good Results):**

- Extend the segmentation framework to include the detection of other diseases or abnormalities present in the dataset.

** Why do this? **

To set a baseline. It already failed with detection. If it fails through this as well, I felt it would be a good motivation.
